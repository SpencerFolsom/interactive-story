She feels at peace for a bit, she is not the only one anymore. Everyone stares at Annie as her mother introduces her. 'Everyone, this is Annie, the daughter I told you about, she is one of us now,' says her mother. Annie’s mom takes her to her home and inside she shows her some of the things she and her dad made for Annie when she was little. Annie’s mother for 3 years spent her time training Annie to learn her powers, making sure she would use them for good and good only. Annie learns lots such as how to control her anger and not let her anger interfere with her powers. Annie’s mother told her plenty of things of the dark world, their enemy was a cult of dark magic that they would often have to fight against. The cult would come to their village every year with some new magic to finally kill the rest of the village. 'There was a war many years before you were born, many of our kind died and we’re all that’s left now.' One night Annie woke up from a nightmare, she tried to calm herself down telling herself it was just a dream. She goes outside to relax for a bit and just as she’s about to open the door she hears something fall behind her. She turns around and there is the guy dressed in all black, his face is covered by a hood. 'Annie,' he says, 'My name is Owen, I have important information you want if you wish to bring your sister back.'Annie realized this was someone who isn’t her kind, no one her kind dresses like that. Out of curiosity, she agrees to listen.'Your sister,' he says, 'I can bring her back.' 'How?' Annie asks.'There’s a spell in a book we have, where you can bring your sister back the only way to cast it is by sacrificing the thing you love most, your mother or your father, you choose.' He says. 'Where is it?' she asks. 'It's in my village, if you wish to bring your sister back you must come with me,' he says. Annie’s mother wakes up she felt it, his presence, 'he’s here,' she thinks to herself. She hides around the corner hearing the conversation between Annie and Owen. She knows Annie would never be so gullible to leave with him. The talking stops, there’s silence, out of curiosity she peers around the corner just as she sees Annie is about to grab his hand and leave. She screams, 'Annie, no, we’ll find another way!' Annie has to make a decision now does she wait to see if she can find another way or does she take her chance now and leave.",
