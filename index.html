       <h1>Skelettdorf</h1>
       <p>‘Twas the 29th of October in the Celtic isles, where a mystical village of bones could be found. The denesinds of this town were born undead, and lived full lives akin to the human tribes found far far away from their home. On the 31st of October, every year, the skeletals celebrate their existence in the form of All Hallows Eve, a festival representing all things spooky. On this particular Halloween, a tragedy will happen, and it's up to you to choose who's eyes to see it through.</p>

It was a sinister war camp of dark elves. The diabolical traitors of the elven lived for mischief and chaos, terrorizing nearby villages for entertainment, and raiding merchant groups out of boredom. At the head of the village, there was a tyrannical, heartless queen, who is known across the land as Zerlu the Malevolent. She sat upon her throne in disgust, for she knew what time of year it was. 'Uggghhh,' groaned the cynical ruler, 'It’s already time for that skeletal eyesore of a festival. Every year, those bright orange lights and loud music blind our view of the valley and keep us up all night. And every year that DISGUSTING goblin tribe raids our village during it!' Zerlu sighed and slumped in her leather throne. 
                    'P-Pardon me, my queen,' said the meek but intelligent Nurbag as he entered the queen’s tent.`,

                'W-Well, U-Umm,' stuttered Nurbag, 'I-It would seem that, according to our scouts, T-The skeletons appear to be preparing for their biggest celebration yet. W-Which means that they may very well be even more of a nuisance this year than the last.' 
                'WHAT?!' exclaimed Zerlu as she slammed her fist down, nearly breaking her throne. Nurbag cowered in fear as the queen steamed with rage. 'This has gone on long enough!' yelled the raging tyrant.
                'W-What should we do madam?' whimpered Nurbag.

                'M-My lady, you really mean to attacktheskeleton village?' asked a fearful Nurbag. 
                'That’s right!' explained Zerlu, 'It was bound to happen eventually. And besides, those boneheads are supposed to have an artifact of great power! With it, we could crush every tribe that opposes us!' Zerlu turned to Nurbag, startling the cowardly elf. 'Assemble me an army to raid the town of bones by tomorrow!' yelled the cruel monarch. 
                'B-But my lady! The skeletons are-'
                'Did I stutter?!' yelled Zerlu, cutting Nurbag off.
                'Y-Yes ma’am! R-Right away ma’am!' said Nurbag as he ran out of the tent. Zerlu returned to her throne and began chuckling to herself, eventually breaking out into an insane laughter that shook the mountain to its core.`

                'We will simply increase defences around the camp and be on high alert when the event starts.' said Zerlu, frustrated.
                'A wise decision m-my queen,' said Nurbag. The dark elves stayed silent during the celebration. Undisturbed, the skeletons did indeed have their biggest Halloween yet.`

                TodAndGrimIntroEnding: `The Queen and her troops approached the village. Zerlu was at the front, riding her shadowy steed, whose fur was like an eternal pit of darkness. 'DARK ELVES!' Zerlu yelled. The elves unsheathed their swords and readied their bows. 'ATTACK!!' roared the twisted queen as the beings of void charges forward and descended on the skeleton’s home. She charged in after them, happily ripping down decorations and smashing oumpkins. It was utter chaos, and Zerlu loved every second of it.
                 As she was lighing the town square up in flames, two young skeletons ran at her, with rage flling their eye sockets. Zerlu scoffed and batted them away with her weapon.
                'Hmph! Pathetic,' taunted the queen.
                'Lady Zerlu!' yelled one of the elvin terrors, 'We have acquired the artifact!'
                'Ha Ha Ha! Good!' laughed Zerlu, 'Come! I think we’ve destroyed the eyesore enough. Back to the camp!' The elves started to retreat.
                'C-Come… back… h-here!' muttered one of the skeletons as they lost conscious. The elves rode off, with their evil queen laughing into the distance.
                Later that night, Zerlu was sleeping in her throne, holding the spoils of her victory in her hand, the crystal skull. She was jolted awake to the sound of an elvin war horn.
                'Y-Y-Your highness! We have an emergency!' cried Nurbag as he ran in.
                'What is it? Is important enough to wake me up for?' Zerlu groaned, still half asleep.
                'T-T-The skeletons my liege! The skeletons are attacking the camp!' wailed the cowardly elf.
                'WHAT?!' roared Zerlu as she raced outside to see the entirety of the skeleton village charging into the war camp, weapons of bone in hand. As zerlu looked out into the chaos, two blurs sprinted past her, snatching the Crystal Skull as they went. 
                'W-What the?! HEY!' exclaimed Zerlu. It was the two skeleton boys she batted away at the village. One of them made a face at her as they ran. Zerlu’s face got so red with anger that Nurbag worried that she might suffer an aneurysm. The skeletons were closing in on the queen and her second hand. The two retreated into the tent. 
                'How are they taking out so many?!' questioned Zerlu furiously.
                'W-Well, there was a r-reason that I was so h-hesitant on your decision to attack the skeletons m-my lady.' said Nurbag. 
                'What?' asked Zerlu with a face as red as a blood moon.
                'S-Skeletons can only die of old age Lady Zerlu. T-They can’t be killed!' answered Nurbag while slowly backing up from the queen.
                'And you didn’t think to tell me why?' inquired the rage-filled queen.
                'W-Well I tried to warn you! A-And in my defence, m-my queen, you hate being corrected or having your i-ideas shot down.' said Nurbag
                'I… ok you’re right,' said Zerlu, her rage vanishing for a second, 'I forget, what was this argument about again?'
                'O-Oh, I believe it was about the-' said Nurbag as he was cut off by a dozen skeletons bursting into the tent. '-skeletons,' finished Nurbag as the skeletons descended on the two.
                The next morning, Zerlu emerged from the rubble of her camp, with dark elves everywhere groaning in pain. Zerlu swore to get revenge on the skeletons, even in it's was the last thing she did.`
