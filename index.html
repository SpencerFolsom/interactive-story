            `Several miles away, sat another village atop a hillside. But this one isn’t as friendly as the skeletal town. It was a sinister war camp of dark elves. The diabolical traitors of the elven lived for mischief and chaos, terrorizing nearby villages for entertainment, and raiding merchant groups out of boredom. At the head of the village, there was a tyrannical, heartless queen, who is known across the land as Zerlu the Malevolent. She sat upon her throne in disgust, for she knew what time of year it was. 'Uggghhh,' groaned the cynical ruler, 'It’s already time for that skeletal eyesore of a festival. Every year, those bright orange lights and loud music blind our view of the valley and keep us up all night. And every year that DISGUSTING goblin tribe raids our village during it!' Zerlu sighed and slumped in her leather throne.
