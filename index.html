            var story = { 
                intro: `Several miles away, sat another village atop a hillside. But this one isn’t as friendly as the skeletal town. It was a sinister war camp of dark elves. The diabolical traitors of the elven lived for mischief and chaos, terrorizing nearby villages for entertainment, and raiding merchant groups out of boredom. At the head of the village, there was a tyrannical, heartless queen, who is known across the land as Zerlu the Malevolent. She sat upon her throne in disgust, for she knew what time of year it was. 'Uggghhh,' groaned the cynical ruler, 'It’s already time for that skeletal eyesore of a festival. Every year, those bright orange lights and loud music blind our view of the valley and keep us up all night. And every year that DISGUSTING goblin tribe raids our village during it!' Zerlu sighed and slumped in her leather throne. 
                'P-Pardon me, my queen,' said the meek but intelligent Nurbag as he entered the queen’s tent.`
            }

            var story = {
                attackingOfVillage: `'Ah, Nurbag,' said Zerlu, noticing her henchman’s presence, 'what news do you bring?'
                'W-Well, U-Umm,' stuttered Nurbag, 'I-It would seem that, according to our scouts, T-The skeletons appear to be preparing for their biggest celebration yet. W-Which means that they may very well be even more of a nuisance this year than the last.' 
                'WHAT?!' exclaimed Zerlu as she slammed her fist down, nearly breaking her throne. Nurbag cowered in fear as the queen steamed with rage. 'This has gone on long enough!' yelled the raging tyrant.
                'W-What should we do madam?' whimpered Nurbag.
                `
            }

            var story = {
                attckTheVillage: `'I’ll tell you what we’ll do!' exclaimed Zerlu, rising from her throne, 'This year we will eliminate that eyesore once and for all!' 
                'M-My lady, you really mean to attacktheskeleton village?' asked a fearful Nurbag. 
                'That’s right!' explained Zerlu, 'It was bound to happen eventually. And besides, those boneheads are supposed to have an artifact of great power! With it, we could crush every tribe that opposes us!' Zerlu turned to Nurbag, startling the cowardly elf. 'Assemble me an army to raid the town of bones by tomorrow!' yelled the cruel monarch. 
                'B-But my lady! The skeletons are-'
                'Did I stutter?!' yelled Zerlu, cutting Nurbag off.
                'Y-Yes ma’am! R-Right away ma’am!' said Nurbag as he ran out of the tent. Zerlu returned to her throne and began chuckling to herself, eventually breaking out into an insane laughter that shook the mountain to its core.`
            }

            var story = {
                doNotAttackVillageEnding: `Zerlu sighed.
                'We will simply increase defences around the camp and be on high alert when the event starts.' said Zerlu, frustrated.
                'A wise decision m-my queen,' said Nurbag. The dark elves stayed silent during the celebration. Undisturbed, the skeletons did indeed have their biggest Halloween yet.`
            }

            var story = {
                TodAndGrimIntroEnding: `The next day, the preparations were nearly complete. Lights were strung, pumpkins were carved, and decorations were set. Two young skeletons, Tod and Grim, were ecstatic! As was the rest of their Skeleton village. The boys sat atop the highest building in the village.
                'I can’t wait for tomorrow night!' said Grim excitedly.
                'You had to have said that thirty times already,' said Tod.
                'Well, can you blame me?' replied Grim, 'All Hallows Eve is the best time of the year! It’s a time for fun, family, and new beginnings!'
                'There’s no denying that!' agreed Tod.
                The two shared a laugh when Tod noticed something on the horizon. 'Hey Grim?' questioned Tod.
                'Yeah?' replied Grim, tilting his head.
                'What’s that all the way over there?' he asked while pointing at the peculiar figures rushing towards the village. Grim squinted his eye sockets as he tried to make sense of what Tod sees.
                'It looks like… people… on horses?' Grim guessed.
                'Yeah but who’s on the horses?' asked Tod.
                'Are those… dark elves?!' gasped Grim.
                'Wait what?!' cried Tod. The dark elves closed in on the village swords and bows in hand. Zerlu was at the front, riding her shadowy steed, whose fur was like an eternal pit of darkness. 
                'DARK ELVES!' Zerlu yelled. The elves unsheathed their swords and readied their bows. 'ATTACK!!' roared the twisted queen as the beings of void charges forward and descended on the skeleton’s home. It was utter chaos. The ripping of spooky decor. The rattling of escaping skeletons. The battle cry of the savage attackers. It was a nightmare come true for the boys, still atop the building, looking out over the chaos.
                'What kind of bone do the dark elves have to pick with us?!' Tod panicked.
                'I-I don’t know!' yelled Grim, 'But what I do know, is that they are destroying all of our hard work! And I also know that we shouldn't be standing by letting this happen!' Grim jumped down from the building and started to run towards the battle.
                'Grim! Wait!' called Tod as he ran after him. The two sprinted to the town square where Zerlu waited, crushing pumpkins and burning down decorations. The boys charged the tyrant, rage filling their bones. Zerlu scoffed and batted them away with her weapon.
                'Hmph! Pathetic,' taunted the queen.
                'Lady Zerlu!' yelled one of the elvin terrors, 'We have acquired the artifact!'
                'Ha Ha Ha! Good!' laughed Zerlu, 'Come! I think we’ve destroyed the eyesore enough. Back to the camp!' The elves started to retreat.
                'C-Come… back… h-here!' muttered Grim as he and his friend lost conscious. The elves rode off, with their evil queen laughing into the distance.
                The boys awoke in the village infirmary several hours after the attack.
                'Uggghhh… I’m bone tired. What happened?' groaned Tod.
                'Oh!' gasped the village doctor, 'You two are finally awake!'
                'How long have we been out?' asked Grim as he got up.
                'Only a few hours,' answered the doctor. The boys thanked the doctor and walked out into the ruins of their once great town. Buildings were in shambles, pumpkins were crushed, and decorations were burned. There were several sobbing skeletons next to some rubble. 
                'How could they do this?' questioned Tod.
                'I don’t know,' replied Grim. The boys then overheard that the crown jewel of their village, the crystal skull, had been stolen by the sinister elves. The boys looked at eachother.
                'Are you thinking what I’m thinking?' asked Tod.
                'Yes, yes I am,' replied Grim.
                The boys snuck into the war camp during the night, with the goal of retrieving the crystal skull in mind. 'Stop shaking, it’ll make your bones rattle!' whispered Grim.
                'I can’t help it!' said Tod, 'Tibia honest, this is insane! We shouldn’t have come here!'
                'Keep it together! We’re almost there!' said Grim. The boys snuck past several sleeping elves on their way to the head. They reached the queen’s tent, and inside, they saw the cruel and malevolent Zerlu, sleeping on her throne, with the crystal skull in her hand. The kids gulped. They slowly entered the tent, creeping their way toward the sleeping tyrant. There was a quiet rattle of shaking bones as the boys quivered in fear. They were meer inches from grabbing the skull and making a run for it, when suddenly, there was the loud sound of a war horn coming from outside the tent. The kids quickly ran and hid behind the throne as Zerlu was startled awake. Nurbag ran into the tent, dropping papers left and right in a panic.
                'Y-Y-Your highness! We have an emergency!' cried Nurbag.
                'What is it? Is important enough to wake me up for?' Zerlu groaned, still half asleep.
                'T-T-The skeletons my liege! The skeletons are attacking the camp!' wailed the cowardly elf.
                'WHAT?!' roared Zerlu as she raced outside to see the entirety of the skeleton village charging into the war camp, weapons of bone in hand. The boys were astonished by the skeletal’s actions. 
                'D-Did they come here for us?' asked Tod.
                'Or did they come here to do what we were going to do?' questioned Grim. The boys knew that they needed to act fast.  The two sprinted past the dark queen, snatching the Crystal Skull as they went. 
                'W-What the?! HEY!' exclaimed Zerlu as the boys ran past her. Grim made a face at her as they ran. Zerlu’s face got so red with anger that Nurbag worried that she might suffer an aneurysm. The boys were almost out when Crane stopped them.
                'Grim! Tod! Did you two numskulls seriously come here alone?!' yelled Crane.
                'W-Well, y-yeah, but we got the skull though!' said Grim.
                'Hey, just know that you don’t need to do things alone ok?' asked Crane.
                'Ok…' the boys responded. The skeletons were closing in on the queen and her second hand. The two retreated into the tent. 
                'How are they taking out so many?!' questioned Zerlu furiously.
                'W-Well, there was a r-reason that I was so h-hesitant on your decision to attack the skeletons m-my lady.' said Nurbag. 
                'What?' asked Zerlu with a face as red as a blood moon.
                'S-Skeletons can only die of old age Lady Zerlu. T-They can’t be killed!' answered Nurbag while slowly backing up from the queen.
                'And you didn’t think to tell me why?' inquired the rage-filled queen.
                'W-Well I tried to warn you! A-And in my defence, m-my queen, you hate being corrected or having your i-ideas shot down.' said Nurbag
                'I… ok you’re right,' said Zerlu, her rage vanishing for a second, 'I forget, what was this argument about again?'
                'O-Oh, I believe it was about the-' said Nurbag as he was cut off by a dozen skeletons bursting into the tent. '-skeletons,' finished Nurbag as the skeletons descended on the two.
                The next day, the villagers were working overtime to repair the damage done by the dark elves and quickly redecorate for Halloween that evening. There was a constant sound of rattling as the skeletons ran about. Somehow, they had most of the village repaired by the evening festivities. That night was spectacular. The boys were paraded through town on the backs of the villagers and were worshiped as heroes for their deeds. The two learned that not every challenge has to be faced alone. And in the end, it really was their best Halloween yet.`
